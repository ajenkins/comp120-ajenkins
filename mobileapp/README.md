Using the application:
* Targets the iPhone on IOS7
* I only tested it in the simulator, so it's not guaranteed to work on a device
* The app interacts with messagehub.herokuapp.com (created by Ming Chow)
* The "Message" tab shows all active messages on MessageHub (inactive messages are filtered
* The "New" tab allows you to send a message to MessageHub
* To see your message and any other new messages, press "Refresh" to reload all messages

All requirements have been successfully implemented, except for the extra credit
(push notifications).
